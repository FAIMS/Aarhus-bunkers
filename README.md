## About this module

This module supports the mapping of urban civil defense systems in Aarhus and was created to facilitate course-related team-based outdoors activities by students of History, Cultural Data Science and Spatial Analytics and other courses taught by Adela Sobotkova or Rosanna Farb√∏l at Aarhus University. It is also available for use by other volunteers interested in public history and community science. 

The module is downloadable from demo.fedarch.org. It contains a user guide and allows the user to register and sign-in, collect coordinates on civil defense features and document their morphology and condition with soft on-device validation requiring the completion of essential fields. User only sees the data s/he collected. Data from the module will be used upon verification to create a spatial dataset and support historical and spatial investigations of Cold War urban civil defenses.
